<p>Price

    The expected Tata Harrier EV price ranges between ₹ 22.00 Lakh - ₹ 25.00 Lakh depending on the variant selected.
    
    When was the Tata Harrier EV unveiled?
    
    Tata Motors showcased the Harrier EV at the Auto Expo 2023 on 11 January 2023.
    
    What variants does it get? 
    
    When the production version of the Tata Harrier EV goes on sale, it is expected to be offered in similar versions as the Nexon EV. This could include XM, XZ, XZ Lux and the likes. 
    
    What features are available in the Harrier EV?
    
    Exterior
    
    The Harrier EV – like its standard version – will be a five-seater. Appearance-wise, it will have a modern grille taking inspiration from the Curvv Concept. Even the headlamp and characteristic LED tail lamps will have a modern lighting signature. Compared to the standard Harrier, the electric derivative is expected to be offered in similar colours seen on the Tiago EV and Tigor EV.
    
    Interior
    
    When the Harrier EV goes into production, we expect Tata to make use of a more modern infotainment system compared to the one used in the standard Harrier. Apart from that, the cabin layout is expected to remain more or less unchanged over the conventionally powered Harrier. The five-seater SUV will offer ample space inside the cabin along with the modern-day creature comfort expected from its segment. This will include digital driver’s display, panoramic sunroof, connectivity, and probably ADAS as well. 
    
    What are the engine, performance and specifications of the Harrier EV?
    
    Tata Motors at the Auto Expo 2023 has confirmed that the Harrier EV is based on the Gen2 architecture. It will also feature an AWD configuration which means there will be a two-motor setup – one on each axle. Other technical details regarding the battery and power output along with range and charging capacity aren’t revealed yet. 
    
    Is the Harrier EV a safe car? 
    
    The upcoming Tata Harrier EV hasn’t been tested for NCAP rating yet.
